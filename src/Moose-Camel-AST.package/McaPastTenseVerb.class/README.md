The past tense indicates that an action is in the past relative to the speaker or writer.
 - when the time period has finished: "We went to Chicago last Christmas."
 - when the time period is definite: "We visited Mom last week."
 - with for, when the action is finished: "I worked with the FBI for two months."

Regular verbs use the verb's base form (scream, work) plus the -ed ending (screamed, worked). Irregular verbs alter their form in some other way (slept, drank, drove).
