I represent a group of verb terminals.

Every sentence has a subject and a main verb. Verbs describe what the subject is doing. To be able to show exactly what the subject does at any time, verbs have different forms and tenses. In order to speak and write English correctly, you must learn the various verb forms and tenses.

Verbs can be of the following types:
 - a verb in present tense; third person and non-third person
 - a verb in past tense
